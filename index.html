		The data I chose corresponds to the foreign-born population of the states (European ancestry only). The idea was to analyze the healthcare and housing metrics of such population: see if they prefer to go with simple house and lack of health insurance. However, there seems to be no obvious trend there. I can conclude that the European immigrants are well-educated and tend to provide for their families well.
