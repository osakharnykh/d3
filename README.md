# D3 project

Project focuses on the analysis of correlation of demographical features among the specified census.

I used the 2014 estimates from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, secifying the information via the American FactFinder tool, and survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Correlation was visualized with a scatter plot and embedded into html.

The data I used is related to European immigrants of the XX century and their family wealth. My research concludes that US legal aliens with European ancestry tend to provide well for their families. They are well educated, and don't rely on social benefits in their life. They tend to either lease, or purchase estate, and have medical insurance at the rate of almost 90%.
